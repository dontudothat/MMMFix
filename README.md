Monke Mod Manager Steam / Revive Fix

# Hello Gorilla Tag Modders / Hackers! 

Monke Mod Manager has been down for quite some time now and I decided to take it upon myself to fix it since nobody else has!

> How to fix the mods using MMM: Turn Real Time Protection off due to false positives detecting it, loading up Gorilla Tag, run the exe and import the mods on the UI that you want!

# LET ME KNOW IF THEIR ARE ANY BUGS SO THAT I CAN FIX THIS REPOSITORY!
